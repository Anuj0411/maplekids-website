## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Is 8 weeks realistic?**
**A:** Yes, for MVP. Full featured version might take 10-12 weeks. Week 1-2 alone is already resume-worthy.

### **Q: What if I don't have AI/ML experience?**
**A:** OpenAI API abstracts the complexity. You make HTTP calls, they handle the AI. The plan includes detailed code examples.

### **Q: Can I do this part-time?**
**A:** Absolutely! 10-15 hours/week = 12-14 week timeline instead of 8. Still very achievable.

### **Q: What's the hardest part?**
**A:** RAG system (Week 4). But the plan has step-by-step implementation guide with code examples.

### **Q: Can I start simpler?**
**A:** Yes! Even Week 1-2 (basic WhatsApp bot) is impressive on a resume. Add AI incrementally.

### **Q: What about costs during development?**
**A:** OpenAI: $5-10 for testing. WhatsApp: Free sandbox mode. Firebase: Free tier. Total: ~₹500-1000.

### **Q: How do I showcase this on resume if not deployed?**
**A:** Even proof-of-concept is valuable. Record demo video, create GitHub repo, document architecture.
